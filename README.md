# Book Rating regression project 

This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand what the main goal and aim of the project is.

## 1. Project Description

This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

- What your application does,
- Why you used the technologies you used,
- Some of the challenges you faced and features - you hope to implement in the future.

## 2. How to Install and Run the Project

If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.


Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Attoumassa/book_rating_prediction_model.git
cd book_rating_prediction_model
git checkout main
```

Create and activate python virtual environment with conda:

```shell
conda create -n "book_rating_prediction_model_env_aamv" python=3.9
conda activate book_rating_prediction_model_env_aamv

## 3. How to Use the Project

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

## 4. Credits
